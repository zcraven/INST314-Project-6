# INST314-Project-6
# This dataset gives insight to 10 different individual responses to questions about three different types of feminism (difference-denying, difference-removing, and difference-honoring). The questions were as follows:

# 1) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 1 (difference-denying feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree"), what number would you pick?

# 2) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 2 (difference-removing feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree"), what number would you pick?

# 3) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 3 (difference-honoring feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree") what number would you pick?

# 4) Which of these three approaches do you think has had the most cultural and political impact in the past few decades ("most" in terms of magnitude, not quality, that is, we don't mean "best", just magnitude)?

# 5) Are you or have been a mother?

# In addition to these questions, respondents were asked to provide their age and occupation, with the option to add their gender if they wanted to.
